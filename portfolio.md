# Juha Jattu - Portfolio
Due to the nature of most of my professional work - internal systems for public and private organisations - and non-disclosure agreements, I am not allowed to publicly present much of the work. Here you can find some snapshots to give an idea about the type of assignments and the quality of work I have done.
