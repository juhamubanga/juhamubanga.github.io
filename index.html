## Digital Design

My educational background is an industrial designer, but my whole working career I have been employed in IT companies, and the title User Experience Designer probably best describes my current main occupation. I have mostly been focused on the user interface development of line-of-business applications, the big core operational systems, for both public and private sector organisations, but I have moved on a quite large area in the industry. I have experience about requirement analysis, website concept development, interaction design, prototyping, web design, front-end design, usability testing and customer workshop facilitation. 

What I am passionate about is creating consistent and effortless user experiences for applications and services used on daily basis, fitting seamlessly to the task they are meant for. I am a curious generalist, getting satisfaction and fulfillment of my work ethics from understanding the bigger why behind peoples' behaviours and decisions and from solving problems by applying design thinking.

During 20 years I have been able to closely follow the development of web, IT systems and the related design and project management methods and gain experience about a multitude of different customer sectors and technical platforms, and have solid knowledge on how information systems can be built with good quality.

### My Process

When I studied industrial design in Lahti Polytechnic, Institute of Design, we shared a lunch cafeteria with students of other occupations at the polytechnic. It was probably the second year into our studies, when we made note of how easily we could distinguish the typical students at the campus cafeteria just by looking at their habitus. You know, the engineer students with their basic jeans, shirts and teenage mustaches, the trade students with their neat business coats, and then us, the design students, who might appear for coffee break directly from our material workshops in dirty overalls, measuring tapes and tools still literally hanging by our waist. As a part of our education, we had already embraced a professional identity, even adopted the social norm of appearance related to it. That early observation, together with later experience and some theory, has given shape to my idea of the design process, largely generalizable to both industrial design of physical objects and digital design of services and user-interfaces. The general process consists of four phases, in all of which a designer can and should play a part.

1. Question
2. Divergence
3. Convergence

#### 1. Question

The goal of any design work is to accomplish a change, hopefully for the better. It all starts by someone, somewhere asking a question about the current state of affairs. What if we created a new product to increase our sales? What if we acquired a new CMS to improve our outdated online presence? The initial question raised may not, however, be the most relevant question for the organisation or business. This is where a consulting designer can help a customer, sometimes even protect the customer from him/herself by challenging the validity of the initial question or assignment. Facilitating the discovery of the most critical question by means of participatory design and bridging of organisational gaps is often necessary. Maybe the CMS is not the problem, but the unclear process or authority over producing web content? The most important task in the beginning is to clear the path for design work by agreeing on what is the most fundamental question to be answered for the organisation wanting to change something.

#### 2. Divergence

The early observation of the separation of professional identities was further strengthened during my career in a big IT company. The company I worked in was big enough to accommodate a thorough separation of work roles, which typically leads to misunderstandings and communication difficulties between people from e.g. marketing, account management, design, software development and infrastructure services. I think the ancient story about the tower of Babel, where people start to speak different languages and become unable to understand each other, is a wonderful description about this phenomenon that probably took place when urban settlements allowed the separation of professions first time in human history. (And of course, speaking different natural languages over multiple continents multiplies this effect in a modern organisation.)
This phase of design is often visually presented as some kind of iterative circle. That is correct in the sense that several iterations are usually necessary to explore the possibilities, obstacles and boundaries in the given design case, before the best or good enough solution can be identified. There is a thousand ways to design the same functionality, and no right or wrong answer, only better or worse ones. However, each iterations consumes time, so I find it more accurate to describe it on a timeline as common phase of a creative process: divergence, the widening area of different possible solutions to the problem at hand. In modern software development, iteration is already built-in (e.g. in SAFe), so it doesn't have to be emphasized in a design process any more, the good common practice from industrial design has already been adopted to software industry.
