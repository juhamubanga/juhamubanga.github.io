## Digital Design

My educational background is an industrial designer, but my whole working career I have been employed in IT companies, and the title User Experience Designer probably best describes my current main occupation. I have mostly been focused on the user interface development of line-of-business applications, the big core operational systems, for both public and private sector organisations, but I have moved on a quite large area in the industry. I have experience about requirement analysis, website concept development, interaction design, prototyping, web design, front-end design, usability testing and customer workshop facilitation. 

What I am passionate about is creating consistent and effortless user experiences for applications and services used on daily basis, fitting seamlessly to the task they are meant for. I am a curious generalist, getting satisfaction and fulfillment of my work ethics from understanding the bigger why behind peoples' behaviours and decisions and from solving problems by applying design thinking.

During 20 years I have been able to closely follow the development of web, IT systems and the related design and project management methods and gain experience about a multitude of different customer sectors and technical platforms, and have solid knowledge on how data systems can be built with good quality.

### My Process

When I studied industrial design in Lahti Polytechnic, Institute of Design, we shared a lunch cafeteria with students of other occupations at the polytechnic. It was probably the second year into our studies, when we made note of how easily we could distinguish the typical students at the campus cafeteria just by looking at their habitus. You know, the engineer students with their basic jeans, shirts and teenage mustaches, the trade students with their neat business coats, and then us, the design students, who might appear for coffee break directly from our material workshops in dirty overalls, measuring tapes and tools still literally hanging by our waist. As a part of our education, we had already embraced a professional identity, even adopted the social norm of appearance related to it. That early observation, together with later experience and some theory, has given shape to my idea of the design process, largely generalizable to both industrial design of physical objects and digital design of services and user-interfaces. The general process consists of four phases, in all of which a designer can and should play a part.

1. Question
2. Divergence
3. Convergence
4. Solution

#### 1. Question

The goal of any design work is to create a change, hopefully for the better. It all starts by someone, somewhere asking a question about the current state of affairs. What if we created a new product to increase our sales? What if we acquired a new CMS to improve our outdated online presence? The initial question raised may not, however, be the most relevant question for the organisation or business. This is where a consulting designer can help a customer, sometimes even protect the customer from him/herself by challenging the validity of the initial question or assignment. Facilitating the discovery of the most critical question by means of participatory design and bridging of organisational gaps is often necessary. Maybe the CMS is not the problem, but the unclear process or authority over producing web content?

#### 2. Divergence

The early observation of the separation of professional identities was further strengthened during my career in a big IT company. The company was big enough to accommodate a separation of work roles, leading to misunderstandings and communication difficulties between people from marketing, account management, design, software development and infrastructure services. In a way, any big organisation is like the tower of Babel, where people speak different languages and are unable to understand each other. (Of course, speaking different spoken languages over multiple continents multiplies the effect.)
