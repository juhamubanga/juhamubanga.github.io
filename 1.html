                                Due to legacy organisational silos, two sales tools needed to be replaced by a single tool, this time using a common design system for company internal tools to save front-end development effort. The tool purpose is to automate and simplify creation of private wireless network offers. The offered customer solutions consist of software, hardware and licenses, some of which are packaged together for simplifying the sales process, some must be customised for each customer case. The offered products have dependencies: some software or hardware may require another one to create a working solution. The business is growing and already 100+ of networks are delivered globally annually, putting pressure on the efficiency of the sales process.

                                The project started a new internal collaboration and after a few briefing meetings I started initial user research with my colleague by doing online interviews for current primary users. We documented the business process, and the benefits and shortcomings of current tools against the business goals, and started crafting a prototype of an ideal tool. I continued facilitating follow-up workshops with stakeholders and users to gather more detailed information about the sales process, the contents and to nail down some contradicting concepts. The design thinking process by applying a novel method, “deductive design”, created by one of my former colleagues, revealed some gaps in the business process and metadata available, which posed a challenge for good UX. A detailed prototype which we created, was essential in communicating the data and process gaps and motivating stakeholders to take actions to bridge them.

                                The solution was essentially a Configure-Price-Quote (CPQ) tool, with a step-by-step process to create a solution offer. What sets it apart from CPQ tools available on the market are the telecom solution content and industry-specific product dependencies. With the step-by-step sequence model, it became possible to enforce the dependencies in smaller chunks, so that selections done in an earlier step acted as filters for the choices available in the subsequent steps. As part of the tool, I came up with a simplified diagrammatic tile representation of a campus area telecom network, by applying the flex layout principle to make the diagram responsive to different browser window sizes, accommodate a variable number of customer case -specific content elements, while also making it developer-friendly and generic. The diagram presentation woke plenty of interest and positive responses from user representatives and turned out especially useful for upsell offers expanding an already existing customer network.
